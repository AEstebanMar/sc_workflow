Total refactorisation of @SergioAlias's sc-cellranger-workflow, integrated with his accordingly adapted sc-neuron-organoids and sc-retina repos. Heavy optimisation, able to exploit supercomputing resources. Easy to use, dynamically coordinates integration according to provided experiment design. Will be integrated in the ExpHunterSuite R package once full workflow is fully functional.
